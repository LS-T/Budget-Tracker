# Budget-Tracker

This application was focused on turning an existing application into a progressive web application. This was accomplished by including the 3 essential things needed for a PWA to function offline. A service-worker and manifest file while also including IndexeDB in a separate  js file to handle any offline activity.  The user is now able to use this application while offline and once back online their pending transactions are automatically processed.



# User Story

    AS a user I want to be able to keep track of my budget offline
    I want to be able to not worry about having an internet connection
    While still being able to interact with the application
    SO that when I hop back online, my offline transactions populate.
